# Assignment 2

This is the "read me" documentation for assignment 2. It explains how to execute the application and contains a guide to the source code.

## How to execute the application

The application requires `application.properties` file, which contains configuration parameters to mysql database, in order to run. We have included a `sample-application.properties` in the `distribution` folder. Before running the system, please fill out the `application.properties` in the `distribution` folder to properly reflect the configuration of your MySQL database.

_To execute on Windows(x64)_

Double click the `app.exe` inside the `distribution` folder.

_To execute on Mac OS X_

```
chmod +x distribution/runApp.sh
./distribution/runApp.sh
```
